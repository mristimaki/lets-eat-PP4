# Testing

## Manual testing

During the development of this project, I've used GitHub's Project Board and throughout the use of the Kanban board I've divided the processes in to a few different sections as follows:
<br>
- **To Do**: (All of the User Stories was initially put in the "To Do" section)
- **In Progress**: (They where then bit by bit moved in to the "In Progress" section during the development)
- **Done**: (And finally moved to the "Done" section when the development was completed)

#### User/Admin Stories

- **Manage posts:** As a **admin** I can **Create, Read, Update and Delete posts** so that **I can manage my blog content**
- **Create drafts:** As a **admin** I can **create draft posts** so that **I can choose to finish my content later**
- **Approve comments:** As a **admin** I can **approve or disapprove a comment** so that **I can filter out the comments and prevent bad behaviour/bullying on my site**
- **View list of recipes:** As a **user** I can **view a list of recipes** so that **I can select which one I want to read**
- **View likes:** As a **user/admin** I can **see the number of likes on each recipe** so that **I can see which one is most popular**
- **Open a post:** As a **user** I can **click on a recipe title** so that **I can read the full recipe**
- **View comments:** As a **user/admin** I can **see the comments on a individual recipe** so that **I can read the conversation**
- **Registration:** As a **user** I can **register an account** so that **I can comment and like posts**
- **View number of comments:** As a **user/admin** I can **view the number of comments on each recipe** so that **I can see if someone has interacted with the content**
- **Comment on a post:** As a **user** I can **leave comments on a recipe** so that **I can interact with the content**
- **Like/Unlike:** As a **user** I can **like or unlike a recipe** so that **I can interact with the content**

During the development of this project I manually tested that the new features was working as expected both on desktops as well as mobile phones. I've used my own devives as well as sent the site to other users to test it out themselves on their devices. The features tested and results are as follows:

### Design
The design of Let's Eat should be responsive so that when looked at in mobile devices, the images should be stacked over each other in Home-page so that the user can see the images better. The blog should be responsive despite which device you're using, since I've used Bootstrap for most of my design features throughout the blog. 

### Lighthouse
I've tested all pages both for desktop and mobile via the Lighthouse tool and got these results:

## General testing

### Methods
1. HTML has been validated in the [W3C HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
2. CSS has been validated in the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
3. I've used the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) tutorials and references troughout my project if there was anything that I got stuck on or needed to be reminded of a certain element or tag.
4. I've used the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to get help with errors during the development process.
