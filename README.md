## Visual Design

### The Fonts
I choosed the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose these particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts.

### The Colors
Insert image of the colors!
 

### The Images
Insert image of the images on homepage!


### The Icons
Insert image of the icons in footer!

The icons are taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. 
<br>
These are found in the footer for social media links.

## Features

### Page Elements

#### Navigation bar
Insert image of navigation bar!

<br>
The navigation bar is located at the top of every page, and is visible even though you scroll down the page, making it easier for the user to navigate back and forth trough the pages. 
<hr>

#### Footer
Insert image of footer!

<br>
The footer is located at the bottom of every page, stating who's the author of all recipes and with links to her social media platforms. I've used a simple design and a hover effect to the icons so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.

## Testing

The design of Let's Eat should be responsive so that when looked at in mobile phones the images should be stacked over each other in Home-page so that the user can see the images better. The blog should be responsive despite which device you're using, since I've used Bootstrap for most of my design features throughout the blog. I've tested all pages both for desktop and mobile via the **Lighthouse** tool and got these results:
### Desktop
Insert image of lighthouse results
### Mobile

### General testing
- I have tested my code troughout the buildup with the **inspect** tool to see what impact the code made.
- I have firstly tested if the code works with mobile devices and then checked the outcome on larger devices. 
- I have used my own mobile phone to check if the website works as it is intended. 
- I have used not only the preview but also the deployed website to check if everything works and looks as intended.
- I have used automated testing with the built in Unittest. You can find the different tests.py in the about directory
