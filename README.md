<img width="1061" alt="landing_page_1" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/ba1ab738-4b32-4868-bf55-b0264f11526e"> 

[Let's Eat](https://lets-eat-0870a5c41672.herokuapp.com/) is a recipe blog as my Project Portfolio 4 for my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.
<br>
<br>
This blog is not as intended from the beginning, I wanted the blog to have more features but I decided to make the project more simple since I didn't have enough time for me to deliver a more complex web application. It got too much for me and I realized that I would not be able to deliver a good working project on the time that I had left since I fell behind a bit during my studies.
<br>
This blog was developed by following along with Django Blog as well as I Think Therefore I Blog from my Code Institute program, and during the development I filled the code or added to the code what best suited my own needs for this application.
<br>
<br>
I have created a simple recipe blog with a simplistic design filled with colors and images that should encourage the visitor to want to go out in nature as well as cooking delicious food! The user can sign up in order to comment and like any of the recipes. The admin can log in to create, read, update and delete posts and comments (CRUD)

## UX

### Site goals
- This blog is developed in a visually pleasing and informative design that is intuitive and easy to navigate in.
- The blog provides the user to easily sign in and be able to like/unlike and comment on each recipe.

## Tasks
The tasks during the development of this project was closely followed by Code Institutes "I Think Therefore I Blog" walkthrough project in this particular order:

#### Before project inception
- Design Wireframes
- Create reporitory in GitHub
- Create Project, Epics, User Stories and preparing Kanban board
  
#### Creating the project in Gitpod
- Creating the django project
- Deploying to Heroku
- Create database Models
- Building the Admin site
- Setting up Templates
- Installing Allauth for sign in, sign up and log out pages
- Installing Crispy forms to style to the Admin django account
- Manual and automatic testing and Validation checks of each page
- Final Deployment

## Visual Design

### Wireframes
I used Marvelapp to create my Wireframes. This is how I first intended the look of the blog but during development I decided to not include all of the features as stated in the beginning. 

#### Landing page desktop

### The Fonts
I choosed the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose the particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts.

### The Colors
<img width="1096" alt="colour_palette" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/35d4e986-f9a9-4577-8e28-102c3c63156f">
I chose these particular colors that reminds me of nature and also provides a clean simple look to the page. I wanted to have simple colors so that the images of the recipes could stand out more. 

### The Images
<img width="1061" alt="landing_page_1" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/dbb4a0b2-6c9c-43a1-9ccd-a331ef35c46b">
The images of the recipes is all taken from [Portionen under tian](https://undertian.com/?s=&post_type=recept&cat=7t&orderby=post_date) recipe blog 

### The Icons

These are found in the footer for social media links.

## Features

### Page Elements

#### Navigation bar
<img width="1061" alt="navbar" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/a9b0175b-d95c-4c83-a24c-f3251b5061b5">
<br>
The navigation bar is located at the top of every page, and is visible even though you scroll down the page, making it easier for the user to navigate back and forth trough the pages. 
<hr>
<img width="500" alt="navbar_mobile" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/c533b95a-898f-4da9-aa2a-5341f7a1e79a">
<br>
The navigation bar on a mobile device is much simpler and gives the user a collapsable menu.
<hr>

#### Footer
<img width="964" alt="footer" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/fe6a9ea8-ff62-4d4d-9278-1bf7f22cf860">
<br>
The footer is located at the bottom of every page, stating who's the author of all recipes and with links to her social media platforms. I've used a simple design and a hover effect to the icons so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.
<hr>

#### The landing page
<img width="1061" alt="landing_page_1" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/470beb92-4204-4e43-b0ee-9fa418fe0987">

<img width="964" alt="about_page" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/fa53a788-9cfe-4853-a49c-e0f7e97a95ec">
<br>
The About page gives the user a simple description of why this recipe blog was created
<hr>

#### Sign Up page
<img width="964" alt="signup_page" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/07d60612-0267-40e5-aad7-7c27ed449ec6">
<br>
The Sign Up page provides the user with a simple form to register to be able to interact with the blog.

#### Sign In page
<img width="964" alt="sign_in_page" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/dd51c130-2204-4591-bcda-b404ba9f0c4d">
<br>
The Sign In page provides the user with a simple form to sign in to their account so that they can like or comment on posts. Once the user is logged in, a simple alert will appear on the page that they have successfully logged in. 
<hr>

#### Logout page
<img width="964" alt="signout_page" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/85e52d74-9c42-4fe1-96ce-f9667e976ce2">
<br>
The Logout page provides the user to log out prom their account, but first a simple question to confirm that the user actually wanted to log out, and then a button to continue to log out. The User will then be redirected to the landing page and given a little alert that says that the user is logged out.

<br>
Appearing at the end of each recipe, the comments appears as a list of comments for the users to see each comment and by whom.

### Feature Ideas
- I want to add a search field so that the user can search for a specific recipe or ingredient.
- For the logged in user to be able to edit or delete their own comments.

## Testing

### You can find all of the test related information in the [TESTING.md](https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/blob/main/TESTING.md) file

### Methods
1. HTML has been validated in the [W3C HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
2. CSS has been validated in the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
3. I've used the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) tutorials and references troughout my project if there was anything that I got stuck on or needed to be reminded of a certain element or tag.
4. I've used the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to get help with errors during the development process.

### Bugs
When adding the RecipeDetail view I got an error that Django pointed to my bootstrap CDN link, it turned out not being the link at all but that I had added the count() function to my RecipeDetail view to count the number of comments, although I already had this functioning here, therefore I got the error:
<img width="565" alt="error-screenshot" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/e71a948c-f490-407c-907d-e2b4a0a7692e">
<br>
After taking out the count() function of my RecipeDetail view, it was up and running again. 
<br>
<br>
When adding the about page I could not get the url to work, after some debugging and finally getting help from a tutor we found out that because of the order I had placed the about path in, the url did not work. After re-arranging the order, the about page worked fine.

### Unfixed bugs
<img width="572" alt="num_comments_not_showing" src="https://github.com/mristimaki/lets-eat-PP4/assets/121927123/d0f28e19-6f20-4903-a4eb-cee0415aa384">
The number of comments are not showing on the landing page as the likes does. I've tried to implement different codes to get this to work but ended up leaving that because lack of time.
<br>
I initially wanted the page header to be a image with text on top, so I had it in my static/images file and styled the header in my CSS file. This did not work when the app was deployed and I could not upload the image to my Cloudinary account either, so I ended up leaving that out and just having a plain color instead.

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment
This site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows.
<br>
- Creating the Heroku App:
- <br>
  - Select "Create New App" in Heroku
  - Choose a name for your app and select the location
- Attach the Postgres database:
<br>
  - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option
- Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
  - In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL
  - In your Gitpod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
  - Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku
  - Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
  - Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, and adding it into the settinge.py file
  - In settings.py add the following sections:
    * Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
    * STATICFILE_STORAGE
    * STATICFILES_DIRS
    * STATIC_ROOT
    * MEDIA_URL
    * DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
    * TEMPLATES_DIR
    * Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
    * Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com, 'localhost'] (Heroku has started to add random numbers to the deployed link, so double check on your Heroku that you have the correct link)
<br>
- Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
  - Create three directories in the main directory: media, storage and templates
  - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
    * web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
  - Log in to Heroku using the terminal heroku login -i
  - Then run the following command: **heroku git:remote -a your_app_name** and replace your_app_name with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpd terminal.
  - After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command **git push heroku main** and your app will be deployed to Heroku
